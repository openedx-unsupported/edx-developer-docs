************
Introduction
************

The edX LMS and Studio have several features that are extensions of the core
XBlock libraries (https://xblock.readthedocs.io). These features are listed
below.

* `LMS`_
* `Studio`_
* `Testing`_
* `Deploying your XBlock`_

You can also render an individual XBlock in HTML; see `Rendering XBlocks with the XBlock URL`_ .

***
LMS
***


Runtime Features
================

These are properties and methods available on ``self.runtime`` when a view or
handler is executed by the LMS.

* anonymous_student_id: An identifier unique to the student in the particular
  course that the block is being executed in. The same student in two different
  courses will have two different ids.

* publish(block, event_type, event): Emit events to the surrounding system.
  Events are dictionaries that can contain arbitrary data. XBlocks can publish
  events by calling ``self.runtime.publish(self, event_type, event)``. The
  ``event_type`` parameter enables downstream processing of the event since it
  uniquely identifies the schema. This call will cause the runtime to save the
  event data in the application event stream. XBlocks should publish events
  whenever a significant state change occurs. Post-hoc analysis of the event
  stream can yield insight about how the XBlock is used in the context of the
  application. Ideally interesting state of the XBlock could be reconstructed
  at any point in history through careful analysis of the event stream.

..  TODO: Link to the authoritative list of event types.

In the future, these are likely to become more formal XBlock services (one
related to users, and the other to event publishing).


Class Features
================

These are class attributes or functions that can be provided by an XBlock to
customize behavior in the LMS.

* student_view (XBlock view): This is the view that will be rendered to display
  the XBlock in the LMS. It will also be used to render the block in "preview"
  mode in Studio, unless the XBlock also implements author_view.
* has_score (class property): True if this block should appear in the LMS
  progress page.
* get_progress (method): See documentation in
  x_module.py:XModuleMixin.get_progress.
* icon_class (class property): This can be one of (``other``, ``video``, or
  ``problem``), and determines which icon appears in edx sequence headers.
  There is currently no way to provide a different icon.


Grading
================

To participate in the course grade, an XBlock should set ``has_score`` to
``True``, and should ``publish`` a ``grade`` event whenever the grade changes.
The ``grade`` event is a dictionary of the following form.

::

    {
        'value': <number>,
        'max_value': <number>,
        'user_id': <number>,
    }

The grade event represents a grade of ``value/max_value`` for the current user.
The ``user_id`` field is optional, the currently logged in user's ID will be
used if it is omitted.


Restrictions
================

A block cannot modify the value of any field with a scope where the ``user``
property is ``UserScope.NONE``.

******
Studio
******


Class Features
================

* studio_view (XBlock.view): The view used to render an editor in Studio. The
  editor rendering can be completely different from the LMS student_view, and
  it is only shown when the author selects "Edit".

* author_view (XBlock.view): An optional view of the XBlock similar to
  student_view, but with possible inline editing capabilities. This view
  differs from studio_view in that it should be as similar to student_view as
  possible. When previewing XBlocks within Studio, Studio will prefer
  author_view to student_view.

* non_editable_metadata_fields (property): A list of ``xblock.fields.Field``
  objects that should not be displayed in the default editing view for Studio.


Restrictions
================

A block cannot modify the value of any field with a scope where the ``user``
property is not ``UserScope.NONE``.


Testing
-------

These instructions are temporary. Once XBlocks are fully supported by
edx-platform (both the LMS and Studio), installation and testing will be much
more straightforward.

To enable an XBlock for testing in your devstack
(https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Developer-Stack), follow these
steps.

#.  Install your block.

    ::

        $ vagrant ssh
        vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo -u edxapp /edx/bin/pip.edxapp install /path/to/your/block

#.  Enable the block.

    #.  In ``edx-platform/lms/envs/common.py``, uncomment::

        # from xmodule.x_module import prefer_xmodules
        # XBLOCK_SELECT_FUNCTION = prefer_xmodules

    #.  In ``edx-platform/cms/envs/common.py``, uncomment::

        # from xmodule.x_module import prefer_xmodules
        # XBLOCK_SELECT_FUNCTION = prefer_xmodules


#.  Add the block to your courses' advanced settings in Studio.

    #. Log in to Studio, and open your course
    #. Settings -> Advanced Settings
    #. Change the value for the key ``"advanced_modules"`` to
       ``["your-block"]``

#.  Add your block into your course.

    #. Edit a unit
    #. Advanced -> your-block

.. link to the XBlock Tutorial changed because now it is external

Note the name ``your-block`` used in Studio must exactly match the key you used
to add your block to your ``setup.py`` ``entry_points`` list. (If you are still
discovering XBlocks and simply used the ``workbench-make-new.py`` script as
described in the `Open edX XBlock Tutorial <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/>`_, look in the
``setup.py`` file that was created.)

*********************
Deploying Your XBlock
*********************

To deploy your block to your own hosted version of edx-platform, you need to
install it into the virtualenv that the platform is running out of, and add to
the list of ``ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES`` in
``edx-platform/cms/djangoapps/contentstore/views/component.py``.


*************************************
Rendering XBlocks with the XBlock URL
*************************************

The XBlock URL supports HTML rendering of an individual XBlock without the user
interface of the LMS.

To use the XBlock URL and return the HTML rendering of an individual XBlock,
you use the following URL path for an XBlock on an edX site.

``https://{host}/xblock/{usage_id}``

Finding the ``usage_id``
========================

.. link to "Finding the Usage ID for Course Content" changed because now it is external

The ``usage_id`` is the unique identifier for the problem, video, text, or
other course content component, or for sequential or vertical course container
component. There are several ways to find the ``usage_id`` for an XBlock in the
LMS, including viewing either the staff debug info or the page source. For more
information, see `Finding the Usage ID for Course Content <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/course_features/lti/lti_address_content.html#finding-the-usage-id-for-course-content>`_.

.. The following section was copied from the file edx-documentation/tree/master/en_us/shared/dev/Section_XBlock_URL.rst.

Example XBlock URLs
===================

For example, a video component in the "Creating Video for the edX Platform"
course on the edx.org site has the following URL.

``https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:edX+VideoX+1T2016/courseware/ccc7c32c65d342618ac76409254ac238/1a52e689bcec4a9eb9b7da0bf16f682d/``

This video component appears as follows in the LMS.

.. image:: ../images/XBlock_URL_example_before.png
    :alt: A video component presented in the context of the edX LMS, with
        navigational options to reach all other course content.

To construct the XBlock URL for the same video component, you obtain its
``usage_id`` and then use the following URL format.

``https://courses.edx.org/xblock/block-v1:edX+VideoX+1T2016+type@video+block@47faf3a03c4f4023b187528c25932e0a``

When you use this URL, the video component appears in your browser as follows.

.. image:: ../images/XBlock_URL_example_after.png
    :alt: A video component presented without any options for accessing other
        course content.

For courses created prior to October 2014, the ``usage_id`` begins with
``i4x://``, as in the following example.

``https://courses.edx.org/xblock/i4x://edX/DemoX.1/problem/47bf6dbce8374b789e3ebdefd74db332``
