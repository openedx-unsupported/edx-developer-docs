Open edX Developer Documentation Hub
####################################

Welcome new and returning Open edX developers!

This is the central repository for documentation that will help you work with Open edX code.


New to Open edX development? Start here
=======================================

This quick overview is intended for developers new to the Open edX platform, junior and senior alike.

After you've reviewed these topics you'll be ready for more detail on our architecture, or you can prepare for active development with the topics in "Information for all Open edX developers."

* :doc:`new_to_edx/mission`
* :doc:`Our code of conduct <universal_stub>`
* `A 15-minute introduction to Open edX systems <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/architecture.html>`_
* :doc:`More about each system <new_to_edx/what_our_systems_do>`
* :doc:`new_to_edx/data_model`
* :doc:`new_to_edx/messaging_model`
* :doc:`What you as a developer can do with the Open edX platform <new_to_edx/what_you_can_do>`

Information for all Open edX developers
=======================================

You will likely use some or all of the information in this section as you progress
in your Open edX development work. Take a look through the topics here before you begin
writing code.


.. From the outline: these topics appear to be of common interest. Are they? i18n, XSS, MFEs (Micro-frontends), IDAs (Independently Deployed Applications, a.k.a. Microservices), Django Configuration/Toggles, Named Releases]

.. list-table::

   * - :doc:`all_development/roadmap/index`
     - Getting your device set up for development, testing, and deployment.
   * - :doc:`all_development/common_tech/index`
     - Common elements shared by core platform and extension work.
   * - :doc:`all_development/contributing/index`
     - If you want to contribute to Open edX code or documentation, review these topics.
   * - `Open edX proposals <https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
     - Help us decide what comes next and see how we made decisions: our technical proposals.

.. Working with the core Open edX platform
.. =======================================

.. If you want to work with the Open edX core systems (course authoring, need to enumerate), review these topics.

.. If you want to contribute to the Open edX repositories, see :doc:`all_development/contributing/index`.

.. WHICH TOPICS ARE UNIQUE TO CORE DEVELOPMENT?

.. * :doc:`working_with_core/working_with_core_topic_1`
.. * :doc:`working_with_core/working_with_core_topic_2`

Extending the Open edX platform
===============================

If you want to extend Open edX functionality, review these topics.

If you want to contribute to the Open edX repositories, see :doc:`all_development/contributing/index`.

.. [From the outline: writing extensions/plugins and theming would go here.]

* `What you can extend <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/guides/extension_points.rst>`_
* `Custom course content and beyond: integrating XBlocks with the platform <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/extending_platform/xblocks.html>`_
* `Adding custom JavaScript applications to courses <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/extending_platform/javascript.html>`_

.. The "JavaScript template" should be a subtopic of "adding custom JS applications."
