Configuration with Environment Variables
****************************************

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Overview
========

Open edX MFEs expect a number of process environment variables (Accessible in node via ``process.env``) in order to properly configure the application. This includes links to other parts of the system, branding elements like the site name and logos, cookie names, and authentication configuration details. Each MFE has ``.env``, ``.env.development``, and ``.env.test`` files that are consumed by the MFE. The production ``.env`` file contains only falsy values â€“ the build process should supply them via the command line prefixing the ``npm run build`` command.

Production build example::

  SITE_NAME="My Site Name" npm run build

The above would only set the SITE_NAME - suitable values for all the other environment variables should be supplied as well.

Required Environment Variables
==============================

All environment variables in this section are required for Open edX micro-frontends.

A note on micro-frontend-specific environment variables
-------------------------------------------------------

Individual micro-frontends may depend on other environment variables not on this list.  Those variables will be documented in the README files in individual micro-frontend repositories, but can be specified on the command line in the same way as described above.

Fundamentals
------------

``NODE_ENV``

Example: ``production`` | ``development`` | ``test``

Used by both the build process and application to determine what type of environment we're running. Valid values are "development", "test", and "production". All production-like environments should use "production", as this removes development warnings and checks, and can enable code optimizations for many dependencies like React. "development" is used by local development servers (i.e., webpack-dev-server, loaded with ``npm start``), and "test" is used by MFE test suites (such as `jest <https://jestjs.io/>`_) run with ``npm run test``.

``PUBLIC_PATH``

Example: ``/``
Used by both the build process and application to set the path of the application.  Should include an initial forward slash ``/``.  Will default to ``/`` if not specified.

``BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://new-mfe.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the micro-frontend being built. Used by frontend-platform as part of authentication, as well as by many applications for internal links.  The above example is on a sub-domain, but micro-frontends can be configured with a path LMS as well.

Internationalization
--------------------

``LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE_COOKIE_NAME``

Example: ``example-language-preference``

The name of the cookie where the user's language preferences should be stored.

Service URLs
------------

``CREDENTIALS_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://credentials.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL of the `Credentials Service <https://github.com/edx/credentials>`_ in the target environment.

``DISCOVERY_API_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://discovery.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL of the `Course Discovery Service <https://github.com/edx/course-discovery>`_ for the target environment.

``PUBLISHER_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://publisher.example.com``
Status: DEPRECATED

**This should be considered deprecated and will be removed from a future release until such time as publisher itself is included in an Open edX release.** The fully-qualified URL of the `Publisher Micro-frontend <https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-publisher>`_.  Today this is only used by micro-frontends that are not offically supported in any Open edX release, such as the `Support Tools Micro-frontend <https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-support-tools>`_.

``ECOMMERCE_BASE_URL``

``Example: https://ecommerce.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL of the `Ecommerce Service <https://github.com/edx/ecommerce>`_ in the target environment.

``LEARNING_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://learning.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL of the `Frontend App Learning <https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-learning>`_ in the target environment.

``LMS_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://courses.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the LMS in the target environment.

``LOGIN_URL``

Example: ``https://courses.example.com/login``

The fully-qualified URL to the login page in the target environment.

``LOGOUT_URL``

Example: ``https://courses.example.com/logout``

The fully-qualified URL to the API endpoint in the target environment which performs a user logout.

``STUDIO_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://studio.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL of Studio in the target environment. This is often used by micro-frontends from which educators may wish to go edit course content, such as `frontend-app-learning <https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-learning>`_

``MARKETING_SITE_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://www.example.com``
Status: DEPRECATED

**This is required, but will be removed in a future release.  Do not use in new code.** The fully-qualified URL of the environment's marketing site.  Today this is used by frontend-app-account to link to a demographics collection page, and also as a base URL for optimizely experiment scripts. Use cases in frontend-app-account will be refactored to use different environment variables, since neither use case has anything to do with marketing.

``ORDER_HISTORY_URL``

Example: ``https://orders.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the `Order History page <https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-ecommerce>`_.  This is often used in a user menu in the header of micro-frontends.

Analytics
---------

``SEGMENT_KEY``

Example: ``ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456``

An implementation-specific environment variable which, when configured, enables integration with Segment, a user analytics and data management vendor. 32 characters.

Authentication
--------------

``ACCESS_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME``

Example: ``example-jwt-cookie-header-payload``

The name of a cookie where JWT authentication data should be stored.

``USER_INFO_COOKIE_NAME``

Example: ``example-user-info``

The name of the cookie where user-specific information should be stored.

``REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT``

Example: ``https://courses.example.com/login_refresh``

The fully-qualified URL of the endpoint which allows the micro-frontend to refresh a user's JWT authentication.  The inconsistency in naming with other fully-qualified URL environment variables is unfortunate.

``CSRF_TOKEN_API_PATH``

Example: ``/csrf/api/v1/token``

The path of the service's CSRF token API endpoint.  This gets prefixed with the domain of a request requiring CSRF protection.  This token is added to the X-CSRFToken header on outgoing requests.

Branding
--------

``SITE_NAME``

Example: ``Your Site Name Here``

The user-facing name of the site.

``LOGO_URL``

Example: ``https://edx-cdn.org/v3/default/logo.svg``

The fully-qualified URL of the site's logo file suitable for use in the application's header.

``LOGO_TRADEMARK_URL``

Example: ``https://edx-cdn.org/v3/default/logo-trademark.svg``

The fully-qualified URL of the site's logo suitable for use in a footer. This is often a logo with a trademark such as (R) or (TM).

``LOGO_WHITE_URL``

Example: ``https://edx-cdn.org/v3/default/logo-white.svg``

The fully-qualified URL of a white version of the logo suitable for dark backgrounds.

``FAVICON_URL``

Example: ``https://edx-cdn.org/v3/default/favicon.ico``

The URL to the favicon.ico file to be used for the site.  This will be added into the index.html file that serves the micro-frontend at build-time.
